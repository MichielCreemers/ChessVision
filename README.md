# Hello !

## Description of project
♟♟♟

## To Do / Done
 - [x] Corner Detection
 - [x] Make Grid
 - [x] Get correct board orientation ❗Very primitive, can be made way more robust ► Check in `board/grid.py` the method `correct_orientation_advanced`❗
 - [X] Label chess pieces
 - [X] Train chess piece recognition model
 - [X] Map detected pieces to grid
 - [X] Output to FEN notation
 - [ ] Best move
 - [ ] Running API communication
