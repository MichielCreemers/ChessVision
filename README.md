## Motivation
Welcome to the ChessVision API, a powerful tool designed to transform the traditional chess experience into an interactive and analytical adventure. This project leverages deep learning object detection architectures and image processing techiniques to analyze photographs of chess boards.

Whether you're a hobbyist looking to analyze your game by saving a digital representation of you physical setup, or a developer seeking to integrate chess insights into your applications, ChessVision provides an easy-to-use API that can enrich your chess playing or analysis.

## Description of project
Currently the API is configured in a way to work together with an adroid app we made that can be downloaded here: [ChessBot.zip](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtF_ruDO-AX-kUiOVJsi6ivtiKqd?e=LOjFOB).

This is just one of the many usecases someone could use this API for.

## From picture to FEN notation
In the picture below is an overview of the pipeline that an input picture goes through to be converted to FEN. Custom datasets were made to train models. **‚ùó Because of this we expect a significant performance drop on other types of chess boards, since our models/datasets are trained/created for one specific type of chess set ‚ùó**

### Corner Detection
Predicting the corners is done using a medium YOLOv8 object detection architecture, the dataset can be downloaded here: [corner-detection-dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/chessar-c1hel/chess-board-detection-3jgw6). A pre-trained model can be downloaded here: [corners_best.pt](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtF_ruDO-AX-kUTz1-GwVH9S7PBd?e=z4Oar3)

### Grid Segmentation
The grid segmentation is done using a small YOLOv8 segmentation architecture. Again a custom dataset for our own specific chess set was made for training and can be downloaded here: [grid-segmentation-dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/chessar-c1hel/chess-board-detection-2). A pre-trained model can be downloaded here: [segment_grid.pt](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtF_ruDO-AX-jiA2mkErqoB3VrHU?e=rlrAb1).

### Piece Detection
The piece detection is done by training both a large and nano YOLOv8 object detection architecture on a custom dataset that can be found here: [piece-detection-dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/chessar-c1hel/chess_pieces_detection-7lqul). A pre-trained model can be downloaded here: [pieces_large.pt](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtF_ruDO-AX-kUPtnTvaNnW-0rdN?e=6rK2Qc) or [pieces_nano.pt](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtF_ruDO-AX-kUYP2Mp7a614Jh5J?e=Dv3fJ0).

### Overview of model performance
<table>
    <tr>
        <th> Model </th>
        <th> Inference time </th>
        <th> MAP50 </th>
        <th> MAP50-95 </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td> NJAAA </td>
        <td> NJAAA </td>
        <td> NJAAA </td>
        <td> NJAAA </td>
    </tr>
</table>
Note the very small drop in precision when going from a large to a nano architecture for detecting the pieces, but a rather big drop in inference time. 

## Flask API
To communicate between the app and the API, Flask is used. This is micro framework that can receive GET and POST requests. As of now, it is set up to be hosted on the a laptop so that all devices in the same can communicate to it. However, it can also be deployed on a server. To be able to connect to the API, the IP address has to be changed in the code of the file chessBot3\app\src\main\java\com\example\chessbot

# Running the Code
Python version 3.11.7 is used. The dependancies can be installed by running:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note that there might be some missing dependancies, I didn't use a specific environment for this project and I wouldn't want you to install 30GB of libraries üòÅ.

1. Start by placing the pre-trained models in the `models/` directory.
