# Hello !

## Description of project
♟♟♟

## To Do / Done
 - [x] Corner Detection
 - [x] Make Grid
 - [x] Get correct board orientation ❗Very primitive, can be made way more robust ► Check in `board/grid.py` the method `correct_orientation_advanced`❗
 - [ ] Label chess pieces
 - [ ] Train chess piece recognition model
 - [ ] Map detected pieces to grid
 - [ ] Output to FEN notation

## Pre-trained models
Pre-trained models can be downloaded here:
* Detecting the corners of the board: [corners.pt](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtF_ruDO-AX-jhIXY82GK4tqbrni?e=OY8b9s)
* Segmenting the tiles: [segment_grid.pt](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtF_ruDO-AX-jiA2mkErqoB3VrHU?e=rlrAb1)
* Training data: [train images in jpg](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AtF_ruDO-AX-jiFG-6Im3EnM0mNI?e=tolJ7L)

## Future Work
- [ ] Board Orientation Detection ► Now just user input
